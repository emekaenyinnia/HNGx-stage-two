# Setting up the project on windows & mac
Setting up Laravel on both Windows and macOS involves similar steps, but there are some platform-specific differences in the setup process. Laravel is a PHP web application framework, and it requires a web server and PHP to run. Here are the general steps to set up Laravel on both Windows and macOS

## Prerequisites:

### Composer: 
Composer is a PHP package manager that Laravel uses for managing its dependencies. You'll need to install Composer.

PHP: Make sure you have PHP installed. Laravel requires PHP 8.1 or later.

### Web Server: 
You can use Apache, Nginx, or the built-in PHP development server. Laravel's built-in development server is suitable for development, but for production, it's recommended to use a full-fledged web server like Apache or Nginx.

### Database:
 Laravel supports various databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and SQL Server. Make sure you have your preferred database system installed and configured.

## Instructions for Windows:

### Install PHP:
Download PHP for Windows from the official PHP website ['Php-for-windows'](https://windows.php.net/download/).
Follow the installation instructions to install PHP.

### Install Composer:
Download and install Composer for Windows from the official website  ['Composer-for-windows'](https://getcomposer.org/download/).



## Instructions for macOS:

### Install PHP:
1, macOS comes with PHP preinstalled. You can check the installed version using the following command:
php -v
You may need to install additional PHP extensions depending on your project's 
requirements.

 * if php is not found
    download php and install php, it should be global
